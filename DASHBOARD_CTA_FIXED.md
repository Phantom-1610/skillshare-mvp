## ðŸ“Š Dynamic Data

### Real Stats (Not Hardcoded!)
```javascript
totalMatches: user?.followers?.length || 0
upcomingSessions: 0 (fetched from API)
unreadMessages: 0 (fetched from API)
averageRating: user?.stats?.averageRating || 0
```

### Profile Completion Logic
```javascript
hasOfferedSkills = user has skills to teach
hasDesiredSkills = user has skills to learn
hasBio = user has bio text
hasLocation = user has location
hasAvailability = user has schedule set
```
