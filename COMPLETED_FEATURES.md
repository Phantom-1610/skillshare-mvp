### How to Test Video Calls:

#### On Same Computer:
1. Open two browser windows
2. Login as different users in each
3. User A: Go to User B's profile → Click "Video Call"
4. User B: Go to Sessions page → Join the same room
5. **You'll see yourself in both windows** ✅

#### Across Different Devices:
1. **Device 1:** Login as User A → Go to User B's profile
2. Click "Video Call" button → Note the room ID (e.g., `call-1729123456`)
3. **Device 2:** Login as User B → Navigate to `/app/video/call-1729123456`
4. **Both users join the same Jitsi room** ✅
5. **Full video/audio communication works** ✅

**Note:** For cross-device testing:
- Both devices must be on the same network OR
- Deploy the app to a public URL (see DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
